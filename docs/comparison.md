# Comparison: Self-Managed MySQL on VM vs. Managed MySQL on Cloud SQL

Completing both parts of the assignment made the differences between running MySQL on a self-managed VM and using Google Cloud SQL very clear. The VM approach required full system administration: installing MySQL manually, editing configuration files, opening firewall ports, fixing authentication issues, and dealing with OS-level restarts. Nearly every step—such as modifying the bind-address, restarting MySQL, or installing additional Python packages like `cryptography` introduced the possibility of errors. I spent most of my time troubleshooting connectivity or MySQL plugin issues, and the entire VM process took roughly an hour from start to finish. While the VM offers full control, it comes with significantly more operational overhead and many opportunities for misconfiguration.

In contrast, the Managed MySQL experience on Cloud SQL was substantially smoother and more controlled. Google handled installation, updates, and system maintenance automatically. Once I enabled the Cloud SQL Admin API and added an authorized network, connecting from both Cloud Shell and Python was straightforward. The platform handled networking, patches, security constraints, and high-availability configuration behind the scenes. The Python script worked almost immediately without needing to adjust system files or restart services. Cloud SQL reduced the setup time to about 45 minutes and eliminated the OS-level responsibilities entirely.

From a production standpoint—especially in healthcare—the managed service is the clearly superior option. Cloud SQL provides built-in encryption, automated backups, monitoring, and the ability to sign a HIPAA-compliant BAA with Google. These capabilities make it far more suitable for storing PHI or supporting any clinical workload. A VM might be acceptable for learning or a very small student project, but it would create unnecessary risk, complexity, and maintenance burden in any real environment. Between reliability, security, and operational simplicity, Cloud SQL is the option I would choose for both departmental analytics databases and HIPAA-aligned workloads.
